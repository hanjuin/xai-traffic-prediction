    x Automatic outlier detection
    x remove timestamp that have continuos zero volume
    x add spatial feature, turning traffic and direction (some detector do not have png for references)
    
% XAI Implementation (SHAP)
    x SHAP Implementation
    x analyze which intersection needed to be improve, based on some KPI index, and then focus on the small road network. 
    x the road network is too complicate to study and analuyze 

% Traffic Validation
    - Study SUMO
    - Create the case study map, with sensor
    


# üö¶ Workflow Pipeline

## 1. Traffic Prediction
- **Input**: Lane-level historical traffic data.  
- **Model**: XGBoost / LSTM / LightGBM.  
- **Output**: Predicted lane volumes per time step.  

---

## 2. Explainable AI (XAI)
- **Method**: Use SHAP (or similar) to explain which features drive predictions (e.g., hour of day, lane type, weather).  
- **Insights**:  
  - *Feature-level*: Why certain lanes congest at certain times.  
  - *Supports hotspot prioritization*:  
    - Example: ‚ÄúXAI shows hour of day + lane type strongly influence congestion at Site 2134.‚Äù  

---

## 3. Hotspot Detection (NEW)
- **Process**: Compute lane utilization & congestion flags.  
- **Combine with XAI insights**:  
  - SHAP says *hour of day* is critical ‚Üí check peak-hour hotspots.  
  - SHAP says *lane type (bus vs general)* matters ‚Üí focus on lanes with high imbalance.  
- **Output**: Prioritized sub-network for simulation.  

---

## 4. Simulation (Focused Area Only)
- **Input**: Convert hotspot volumes ‚Üí SUMO routes/flows.  
- **Process**: Run SUMO for the sub-network only.  
- **KPIs Extracted**:  
  - Travel time  
  - Queue length  
  - Emissions  
  - Throughput  

---

## 5. KPI Post-Processing
- **Summarize**: Simulation results into policy-ready metrics.  
- **Scenario Comparison**:  
  - Base vs Bus Lane vs Ramp Metering vs Dynamic Signage.  

---

## 6. LLM Policy Generation
- **Input**: KPI summaries + hotspot context + XAI insights.  
- **Output**: Policy recommendations:  
  - Adaptive bus priority  
  - Lane reallocation  
  - Ramp metering  
  - Dynamic signage
