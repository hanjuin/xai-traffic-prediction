# Dissertation - Explainable AI for Traffic Prediction

This repository will contain the code, data, and documentation for my Master's dissertation project at Auckland University of Technology (AUT).  
The research focuses on building a pipeline that integrates **AI-based traffic prediction**, **explainable AI (XAI) techniques**, and **large language models (LLMs)** to generate traffic policy suggestions. The proposed policies will be validated through simulations using **SUMO (Simulation of Urban MObility)**.  

At this stage, the repository serves as a placeholder and will be updated progressively as the project develops.  

## Structure (Planned)
- `data/` â€“ Datasets used for training, testing, and simulation  
- `notebooks/` â€“ Jupyter notebooks for experiments and analysis  
- `src/` â€“ Source code for prediction models, explainability methods, and simulation integration  
- `results/` â€“ Experimental results and visualizations  

## Status
ðŸš§ Work in progress â€“ project setup ongoing.
