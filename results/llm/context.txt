Project: Auckland CBD Traffic Simulation

This simulation models the Auckland CBD morning peak-hour traffic conditions (7–9 AM) to identify congestion hotspots and generate data-driven policy recommendations.

Objectives:
- Reduce congestion
- Improve average vehicle speed and flow.
- Support eco-friendly and low-cost policy decisions.

Simulation setup:
- Time range: 0–3600 seconds (1 hour)
- Network: Auckland CBD arterial network
- Detector data collected for flow, speed, and occupancy
- Trip generation based on average morning demand

Constraints:
- Budget limits prevent large-scale road widening.
- Focus on signal optimization, dynamic lane use, and sustainable policies.

Existing Auckland transport policies:
- Ramp metering on motorway on-ramps
- Dynamic lane control on Auckland Harbour Bridge
- Bus lanes on major CBD corridors
- Public transport promotion through AT Metro
- Traffic signal coordination

Expected output:
- Identify key congestion sites.
- Suggest short-, medium-, and long-term policy options.
- Justify each recommendation with detector or simulation data.
- Present results in a structured table format.
